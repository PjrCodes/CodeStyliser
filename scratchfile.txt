you found a valid condition or loop with all parenthese closed and you are redy to add a {
    -> add {
    -> set a variable that } is pending
    -> first check that the next non comment and non whitespace is if () etc and also switch
    -> if it is one of the keywords, then, check if it has curly brace..
    -> then, keep storing all {} until you find a close of this like the logic used for ()
    -> once the } is found add your pending }
    -> reset the variable of pending
